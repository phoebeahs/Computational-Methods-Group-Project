#Just gonna start working here
#Testing if the file even saves lol

#Question
#Solve the 3 DoF equations of motion of the airplane. The simulation should start from a 
#trim initial condition and then compute the response of the system to time-dependent
#commands such as a variation of the thrust T and elevator angle Î´E , or a combination of
#the two

#What we know: 
#Coeffcients for Cl,Cm, Cd from pt 1. 
#Angle of attack, thrust, and elevator angle from pt 2.

#Need to know...
#What 3 eqns are the DoF eqns of motion?
#What are the trim intial conditions?
#What are the trim intial conditions
#If we need a variation of thrust and elevator angle, will we get a variation of values from pt2 or just one set value?
#'Time dependent Commands' - how much time lol?
